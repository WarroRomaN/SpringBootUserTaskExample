Requirements:
Technology Stack:
Java
Spring Boot
Maven
RESTful API design
Groovy Spock for testing (can be anything else)
API Endpoints:
Get Slot Info
Spin
Business Logic:
The slot machine has 3 reels
Each reel can have one of the following symbols: A, B, C, D, E
Each symbol has itâ€™s own multiplier applied if was won
User should be able to choose the bet he wants to play with
Win combination is 3 the same symbols in one line
The spin result should be randomly generated
If the spin result is a winning combination, the user wins an amount calculated as betAmount * multiplier
Algorithm for Reels Randomization
Implement a randomization algorithm that generates the result for the 3 reels independently
Ensure fairness in the randomization process
Testing
Define and implement all required level of testing
Expectations
Only result matters. All available tools can be used to receive the final code as soon as possible.
